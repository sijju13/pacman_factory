# Pacmen Factory
## Description: 
This is a game to simulate the movment of Pacmen across the screen and in reversing direction. We are going to create a web page that produces PacMen with the click of a button "Add Pacman" and when you click another button "Start Game" each of them enters the screen and moves in a random projected track. When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web-page. You can add as many Pacmen you like. 

## How to Run:
* Fork and close the repository locally. 
* Run the index.html file on a web browser.
* Click "Add Pacman" to add as many Pacmen you like on the screen 
* Click "Start Game" to see the Pacmen move across the screen and in reversing random direction and velocity. 

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Having the Pacmen change size, color and mouth movements while changing direction.
